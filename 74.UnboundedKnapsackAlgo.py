# Unbounded Knapsack: Given n item types each with a weight and value, 
# and a knapsack capacity W, choose items (each item may be chosen unlimited times) 
# so the total weight â‰¤ W and total value is maximized.
# This is typically solved with dynamic programming (bottom-up) in O(n * W) time.

# Explanation

# Unlike 0/1 Knapsack where each item can be taken at most once, in Unbounded Knapsack 
# you can take any item multiple times.

# Let dp[w] be the maximum value achievable with capacity exactly w. Base: dp[0] = 0.

# For each capacity w from 1 to W, try every item i with weight wt[i]. If wt[i] <= w, 
# candidate value = dp[w - wt[i]] + val[i]. Set dp[w] = max(dp[w], candidate).

# This 1D bottom-up DP naturally allows reusing items because when computing dp[w] you may use 
# dp[w - wt] which itself may include item i already.

# Optionally store a keep[w] array to reconstruct which item was chosen last for capacity w.

            if candidate > dp[w]:
                dp[w] = candidate
