# Tree DP (dynamic programming on trees) is a technique that computes answers for tree problems
# by combining solutions of children to form the parent's solution. It commonly uses DFS (post-order) 
# to compute state values (e.g., include / exclude a node) for each node. This avoids recomputation 
# and exploits tree structure.

# Explanation

# A common pattern in Tree DP is to maintain multiple DP states per node that represent different
# constraints (for example: whether the node is chosen or not). We process the tree in 
# post-order (children first), compute DP states for every child, and then combine them to c
# ompute the parentâ€™s states. This is especially useful for problems like the Maximum Weight Independent 
# Set on a tree, tree vertex cover, subtree sums, or longest path computations.
