# The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) is the longest subsequence in 
# a given sequence where all elements are in strictly increasing order.
# The elements of the subsequence donâ€™t need to be contiguous, but their order must be preserved.

# Explanation

# Imagine you have an array of numbers, and you want to find the longest possible 
# sequence that increases as you move forward.

# Example:
# ðŸ‘‰ Input: [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]
# ðŸ‘‰ Possible Increasing Subsequences:

# [10, 22, 33, 50, 60]

# [10, 22, 33, 41, 60]

# Both have length 5, so the LIS length = 5.

# We can solve this problem in O(NÂ²) using Dynamic Programming:

# For each element, check all previous elements.

# If the current element is greater than a previous one, we can extend the subsequence.

# Store the length of the LIS ending at each element and take the maximum.

    dp = [1] * n

    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(0, i):
            if arr[i] > arr[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)

    return max(dp)

arr = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]
